## 📌 Overview
The **California House Price Prediction** project leverages machine learning to forecast house prices based on various factors such as location, median income, and average rooms per household. By building a comprehensive data pipeline, we aim to predict house prices with high accuracy and provide actionable insights.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fujelhrx/California-House-Model.git
   cd california-house-price-prediction
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

---


## 🛠 Usage
- Open `California_house_model.ipynb` and run all cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate predictions.
- For command-line usage, execute the training script:
   ```bash
   python src/california_house_model.py
   ```

---


## Custom Transformers Example

The script demonstrates how to build custom transformers using `BaseEstimator` and `TransformerMixin`, such as:
- `StandardScalerClone`: A custom standard scaler.
- `ClusterSimilarity`: Computes RBF kernel similarity to cluster centers.



## Future Improvements

- Add machine learning model training and evaluation.
- Optimize the feature engineering process.
- Implement hyperparameter tuning for better prediction accuracy.
